# Quake Log Parser

## Description

This project is a log parser for the Quake 3 Arena game, which groups information from each match, including kills, players, and the means of death, and generates detailed reports in JSON format.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.16 or higher)
- Compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Project Structure

```bash
parser-golang/
├── main.go               # Main entry point of the application
├── display.go            # Script for displaying the parsed JSON data in a user-friendly format
├── parser/               # Contains the log parsing logic
│   ├── parser.go         # Core log parsing functionality
│   └── models.go         # Data models used by the parser
├── logs/
│   └── quake_game.log    # Quake 3 Arena game log file (place your log file here)
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── go.mod                # Go module file
```

## How to Run

### 1. Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hevertydourado/parser-golang.git
cd quake-log-parser
```

### 2. Preparing the Log File

Place the Quake 3 Arena log file you want to analyze into the `logs/` directory with the name `quake_game.log`.

### 3. Parsing the Log File

Run the following command to parse the log file and generate JSON reports:

```bash
go run main.go logs/quake_game.log
```

This will output the JSON reports to the terminal.

### 4. Displaying the Parsed Data

To display the parsed data in a more user-friendly format, you can use the `display.go` script. This script takes the JSON output generated by the `main.go` script and formats it for easier reading.

#### Usage

First, ensure the JSON output from the `main.go` script is saved to a file, for example `quake_report.json`.

Then, run the `display.go` script as follows:

```bash
go run display.go quake_report.json
```

This will print a nicely formatted version of the reports to the terminal, including:

- Player rankings by kills
- Detailed match reports
- Breakdown of kills by the means of death

## Example Output

When you run the `display.go` script, the output might look something like this:

```
===== Player Ranking =====
1. Isgalamido - 147 kills
2. Zeh - 124 kills
3. Oootsimo - 114 kills
...

===== Match Reports =====

Match: game_01
Total Kills: 45
Players: Isgalamido, Dono da Bola, Zeh
Kills:
  Isgalamido: 18 kills
  Dono da Bola: 15 kills
...

===== Kill by Means Reports =====

Game: game_01
Kills by Means:
  MOD_SHOTGUN: 10 kills
  MOD_ROCKET_SPLASH: 7 kills
  MOD_RAILGUN: 5 kills
...
```
